## Estimo

Estimo is a tool for measuring parse / compile / execution time of javascript.

This tool can emulate CPU throttling, Network conditions, use Chrome Device emulation and more for measuring javascript performance.

_Inspired by [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit). Thanks [@ai](https://github.com/ai/) and [@aslushnikov](https://github.com/aslushnikov) for support._

## Why?

**JavaScript** is the **most expensive part** of our frontend.

![3.5 seconds to process 170 KB of JS and 0.1 second for 170 KB of JPEG. @Addy Osmani](./js_vs_jpeg.webp)

**3.5 seconds** to process 170 KB of JS and **0.1 second** for 170 KB of JPEG.

## Usage

**JS API**

```js
const path = require('path')
const estimo = require('estimo')

;(async () => {
  const report = await estimo(path.join(__dirname, 'examples', 'example.js'))
  console.log(report)
})()
```

**CLI**

```sh
estimo -r ./examples/example.js
```

**Output**

```js
;[
  {
    name: 'example.js',
    parseHTML: 1.01,
    styleLayout: 34.08,
    paintCompositeRender: 1.4,
    scriptParseCompile: 1.04,
    scriptEvaluation: 8.11,
    javaScript: 9.15,
    garbageCollection: 0,
    other: 8.2,
    total: 53.84
  }
]
```

## Fields Description

- **name** - Resource name (file name or web url).

- **parseHTML** - Time which was spent for `ParseHTML`, `ParseAuthorStyleSheet` events.

- **styleLayout** - Time which was spent for `ScheduleStyleRecalculation`, `UpdateLayoutTree`, `InvalidateLayout`, `Layout` events.

- **paintCompositeRender** - Time which was spent for `Animation`, `HitTest`, `PaintSetup`, `Paint`, `PaintImage`, `RasterTask`, `ScrollLayer`, `UpdateLayer`, `UpdateLayerTree`, `CompositeLayers` events.

- **scriptParseCompile** - Time which was spent for `v8.compile`, `v8.compileModule`, `v8.parseOnBackground` events.

- **scriptEvaluation** - Time which was spent for `EventDispatch`, `EvaluateScript`, `v8.evaluateModule`, `FunctionCall`, `TimerFire`, `FireIdleCallback`, `FireAnimationFrame`, `RunMicrotasks`, `V8.Execute` events.

- **javaScript** - Time which was spent for both event groups (**scriptParseCompile** and **scriptEvaluation**).

- **garbageCollection** - Time which was spent for `MinorGC`, `MajorGC`, `BlinkGC.AtomicPhase`, `ThreadState::performIdleLazySweep`, `ThreadState::completeSweep`, `BlinkGCMarking` events.

- **other** - Time which was spent for `MessageLoop::RunTask`, `TaskQueueManager::ProcessTaskFromWorkQueue`, `ThreadControllerImpl::DoWork` events.

- **total** - Total time.

## Time

**All metrics are in milliseconds**.

We measure system-cpu time. The number of seconds that the process has spent on the CPU.

We not including time spent waiting for its turn on the CPU.

## Multiple Runs

All results measured in time. It means that results could be unstable depends on available on your device resources.

You can use `runs` option to run estimo N times and get median value as a result.

**JS API**

```js
const report = await estimo(['/path/to/examples/example.js'], { runs: 10 })
```

**CLI**

```sh
estimo -r /path/to/examples/example.js -runs 10
```

## Diff Mode

You can compare metrics of an origin file with others its versions to understand consequences on performance.

We take the first file as a baseline. All rest files will be compared with the baseline.

**JS API**

```js
const report = await estimo(['lib-1.0.5.js', 'lib-1.1.0.js'], { diff: true })
```

**CLI**

```sh
estimo -r lib-1.0.5.js lib-1.1.0.js -diff
```

**Output**

```js
;[
  {
    name: 'lib-1.0.5.js',
    parseHTML: 1.48,
    styleLayout: 44.61,
    paintCompositeRender: 2.19,
    scriptParseCompile: 1.21,
    scriptEvaluation: 9.63,
    javaScript: 10.84,
    garbageCollection: 0,
    other: 9.95,
    total: 69.06
  },
  {
    name: 'lib-1.1.0.js',
    parseHTML: 2.97,
    styleLayout: 61.02,
    paintCompositeRender: 2.11,
    scriptParseCompile: 2.11,
    scriptEvaluation: 19.28,
    javaScript: 21.39,
    garbageCollection: 0,
    other: 15.49,
    total: 102.98,
    diff: {
      parseHTML: '2.97 (+50.17% ðŸ”º)',
      styleLayout: '61.02 (+26.9% ðŸ”º)',
      paintCompositeRender: '2.11 (-3.8% ðŸ”½)',
      scriptParseCompile: '2.11 (+42.66% ðŸ”º)',
      scriptEvaluation: '19.28 (+50.06% ðŸ”º)',
      javaScript: '21.39 (+49.33% ðŸ”º)',
      garbageCollection: '0 (N/A)',
      other: '15.49 (+35.77% ðŸ”º)',
      total: '102.98 (+32.94% ðŸ”º)'
    }
  }
]
```

## Additional Use Cases

### CPU Throttling Rate

The CPU Throttling Rate Emulation allows you to simulate CPU performance.

- **cpuThrottlingRate** (default: `1`) - Sets the CPU throttling rate. The number represents the slowdown factor (e.g., 2 is a "2x" slowdown).

**JS API**:

```js
await estimo('/path/to/example.js', { cpuThrottlingRate: 4 })
```

**CLI**:

```sh
estimo -r ./examples/example.js -cpu 4
```

### Network Emulation

The Network Emulation allows you to simulate a specified network conditions.

- **emulateNetworkConditions** (default: `undefined`) - One of [puppeteer network conditions descriptor](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v11.0.0&show=api-puppeteernetworkconditions).

**JS API**:

```js
await estimo('/path/to/example.js', { emulateNetworkConditions: 'Slow 3G' })
```

**CLI**:

```sh
estimo -r ./examples/example.js -net Slow\ 3G
```

### Chrome Device Emulation

The Chrome Device Emulation allow you to simulate a specified device conditions.

- **device** (default: `undefined`) - One of [puppeteer devices descriptor](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&version=v11.0.0&show=api-puppeteerdevices).

**JS API**

```js
const report = await estimo('/path/to/example.js', { device: 'Galaxy S5' })
```

**CLI**

```sh
estimo -r ./examples/examples.js -device Galaxy\ S5
```

When using CLI, for device names with spaces you should use symbols escaping.

### Changing default timeout

You can specify how long estimo should wait for page to load.

- **timeout** (default: `20000`) - Sets timeout in ms.

**JS API**:

```js
await estimo('/path/to/example.js', { timeout: 90000 })
```

**CLI**:

```sh
estimo -r ./examples/example.js -timeout 90000
```

### Multiple Resources

**JS API**

```js
const report = await estimo([
  '/path/to/libs/example.js',
  '/path/to/another/example/lib.js'
])
```

**CLI**

```sh
estimo -r /path/to/example.js https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js
```

### Pages

You can use all features not only with js files, but with web pages too.

We will wait for navigation to be finished when the `load` event is fired.

**JS API**

```js
const report = await estimo('https://www.google.com/')
```

**CLI**

```sh
estimo -r https://www.google.com/
```

## Install

```js
npm i estimo
```

or

```js
yarn add estimo
```

## How?

It uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to generate Chrome Timelines. Which can be transformed in human-readable shape by [Tracium](https://github.com/aslushnikov/tracium).

We will use your local **Chrome** if it suitable for using with Estimo.

**Keep in mind** there result depends on your device and available resources.
